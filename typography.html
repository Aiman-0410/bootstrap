                <p class="text-left"> Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.</p>  
                <p class="text-right">The term technology is derived from the Greek word technologia. The term was originally used to describe a discourse on the arts, both fine and applied. Over time, the term has come to be associated more with the practical arts than with the fine arts.</p>
